## This repo and my experience

### How to colaborate

Did you want to colaborate? check the
[CONTRIBUTING][contributing-link] page.

### When and why did I start?

This will depend:

  - **with the Rust language?** I already knew the language since
    September-24. I started learning more in depth in December.

  - **with AoC?** I discovered AoC through a YouTube video
    _([Lucas Montano from Lucas Montano Channel][lucas-montano])_.
    They said it was an event where you can solve puzzles with any
    programming language. Why not rust?

  - **with this project?** I started around December 10th, stopped
    development, and then returned to the project.

### My opinion on the language

Definitely **100/10** ðŸŒŸ

I'm a big fan of strongly/static typed languages. Rust did very well
in my programming experience. I'm still in Ownership and Borrowing
hell, but they seem like a feature the language needs so that
everything works fine.



## Tips

### Your terminal 1

The program consists of a bunch of **formatted** and **colored**
text, which is **printed** and then **deleted**. Having a modern
terminal (that supports these features) is recommended. I used
[Alacritty][alacritty-link] during development and it served
perfectly well.

### You terminal 2

There are some problems for print and clean the terminal. Everything
works, as long as the terminal is not resized. So, the bigger the
terminal, the better it will run. _(full screen is highly
recommended)_
