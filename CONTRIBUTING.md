Contributing to RoC-2024
========================

Did you want to contribute/colaborate with the project? See how:

- I found a bug! 🐞
- There's some misinformation at docs! 🔎
- I have a question! ❓

These three items listed above are issue templates that you can find
by sending an [issue][isse-link].

I highly recommend reading the entire documentation. Maybe there is
already a solution to your problem at `README` or `OUTRO`.

## How about Pull Requests?

The project will not have pull requests as its objective has already
been achieved.
